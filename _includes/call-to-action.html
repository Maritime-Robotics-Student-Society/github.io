With emerging robotics technology, sailboat is gaining increased interest because its potential in providing a continuous access for ocean data at extreme low cost.

Unmanned sailing, however, is a challenging task that involved with complex dynamic interactions between environment.

To wider the application of autonomous sailing platform, we initiate this open-source project to develop and share our design with educators, hobbyists and researchers.
